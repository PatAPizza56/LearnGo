# Learn GO

## About

This project was created as a basis for me to learn go. I made sure to include many different features that are commonly used in the GO language,
so I could this project as a reference for future projects.

## Includes

- Variable creation and initialization
- Types and structs
- Pointers and values
- Functions with void and value return types
- For loops
- Concurrency
